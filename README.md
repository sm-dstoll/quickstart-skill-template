# QuickStart Skill Template v1.0

This repository is intended to quickly demonstrate how to connect a custom skill to a digital person in DDNA Studio and test in a local environment. 

## Running the skill server

1. Run `npm install` in root of project
2. Run `npm run dev` in terminal to start project at port 4000
3. For development, create tunnel using [localtunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose localhost to DDNA Studio
4. Add tunnel address to the `skill-def.json` `endpointExecute` property
5. Copy/paste `skill-def.json` into "Create Skill" section of DDNAS and connect newly created skill to your project

When connected, this skill will return user utterances in the format "User said: <User Utterance>". By inspecting the `index.js` code base, you can gain an understanding of how to access the user text from the request as format the return to the digital person.

Skill definition can be updated to take advantage of other lifecycle skill methods, such as the `/init` & `/session` endpoints.
